康熙帝（1654 年 5 月 4 日-1722 年 12 月 20 日） ，原名愛新覺 羅·玄燁，滿族，清聖祖仁皇帝。在除去最有野心的輔政大臣鰲 拜，並廢除了輔政體制後，開始親政。在政治方面，康熙親身 打理事務，加強皇權。在軍事方面，他平定了三藩之亂，又收 復台灣，維護了國家的統一。在經濟方面，他採取輕徭薄賦， 與民生息的政策，體現了他仁愛的一面。康熙不僅重視禮教， 更對內安撫，使民族團結。雖康熙晚年有過失，如利用「文字 獄」打擊漢族異議人士，但也令清朝成為當時世界上人口眾 多、經濟富庶的帝國，亦開創康乾盛世的局面。

The Emperor Kangxi (1654 to 1722 CE, Posthumous name: Rendi) strengthened the imperial power upon the removal of the regent Oboi and disbandment of the regency. He settled the Revolt of the Three Feudatories and took back Taiwan, safeguarding the unity of the country. He eased the civilians’ financial burdens by reducing tax rates. He not only valued Feudal ethics, but also took care of all people, allowing him to unite the country. In his later years of reign, despite the faults, such as the use of literary inquisition, he brought the Qing Dynasty to be the world’s most populous empire. His reign was known as the "Prosperous Era of Kangxi and Qianlong".
