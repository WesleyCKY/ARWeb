SHANG Yang (390 to 338 BCE) was a commander-in-chief in the state of Wei during the Warring States period. He was also a representative figure of the Chinese Legalism, which he studied in his early years. After moving into the state of Qin, he transformed the Qin empire into a rich and powerful state through several political reforms. His reforms, which are historically known as the “Shang Yang’s Reform”, included reforming the Qin’s existing systems, encouraging agricultural activities, restraining business activities, and recovering the lost land in the Hexi region. However, former nobles’ interests were severely affected due to the reforms. They took revenge and killed him eventually.
