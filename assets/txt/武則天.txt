武曌（624 年 2 月 17 日－705 年 12 月 16 日），武周開國皇 帝，當代稱武后，後代通稱武則天，中國歷史上唯一因執掌君 權因而得到正史追認的女性皇帝，漢族。由於唐高宗患風眩 病，無力聽政，武曌從此開始臨朝，並利用酷吏集團殺害唐室 諸王大臣來立威，終於自立為武周皇帝。後來被張柬之與禁衛 軍背叛，被迫還位，隨後成為中國歷史上唯一一位女性太上 皇，同年崩於洛陽上陽宮仙居殿。雖武曌有不少負面評價如重 用酷吏，但她亦知人善任，政策穩當，百姓富裕，故有「貞觀 遺風」的美譽。

WU Zhou (624 to 705 CE) is the only female emperor officially recognised in Chinese history. Since Emperor Gaozong of Tang was incapable of managing state business, she began to involve in the governance of the state and solidified her power with tortures and harsh punishment. After that, she declared herself the Empress regnant of Wu Zhou. In her later years, she was forced to give up the throne upon the betrayal of Zhang Jian-ji and the imperial guards. Although there were negative comments towards her, she could always choose the right person to do his/her best. Therefore, her reign was also regarded as the legacy of Zhengguan.
