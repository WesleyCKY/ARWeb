趙匡胤（927 年 3 月 21 日 - 976 年 11 月 14 日），別名趙九 重，宋朝開國皇帝，漢族。在後周建立後，趙匡胤始入軍旅， 並屢建戰功。後來被任命為殿前都點檢，掌管殿前禁軍。隨後 在「陳橋兵變」中被擁立為帝。回京後，趙匡胤登基，改元建 隆，國號「宋」（北宋）。趙匡胤在位期間完成了全國大部的 統一，並發起了「杯酒釋兵權」，罷去禁軍將領及地方藩鎮的 兵權，解決了自唐朝中葉以來地方節度使擁兵自擅的局面。此 外，趙匡胤亦改革科舉、軍制，因此他是中國歷史上一個承前 啟後的重要人物。

ZHAO Kuang-yin (927 to 1976 CE) was the founding emperor of the Song Dynasty. After the establishment of the Late Zhou Dynasty, Zhao was promoted to a chief commander of the imperial guards. He ascended the throne after the Coup at Chen Bridge and changed the year of Yuan to Jianlong, along with the new dynasty name, Song or Northern Song.  During his reign, he brought the military power from the generals and prefectures under imperial control. In addition, Zhao reformed the imperial examination and military systems. Hence, he became a crucial figure who “followed the past and heralded the future” in Chinese History.
