LI Zi-cheng (1606 to 1645) was a leader of peasant rebellions in the late Ming Dynasty. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, serious political corruption caused rebellions in various places. He was the “Dashing King” in the rebel army. Li declared himself the Emperor in Xi'an and founded the Shun Dynasty or the Great Shun. After that, he attacked Beijing and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide, historically called the “Battle of Beijing”. Shortly, Li was defeated by Wu San-gui in the “Battle of Shanhai Pass” and had to abandon Beijing as well as Xi’an one by one. He was killed while looking for an escape route eventually.
