乾隆帝（1711 年 9 月 25 日-1799 年 2 月 7 日）原名愛新覺羅· 弘曆滿族，清朝第六位皇帝。乾隆即位初期，集中力量糾正的 一些弊政，以儒家理念為指導，對百姓實行仁政。到了初中 期，他開始嚴肅處理貪污案件，更親自甄選官員，整頓吏治。 在軍事方面，他發起了一連串軍事行動，如清緬戰爭、清越戰 爭等，奠定版圖。在經濟方面，他重視農業，並鼓勵開荒，擴 大種植面積。在文化方面，他親自倡導並編成了《四庫全 書》，是中國歷史上規模最大的重要古籍。雖乾隆為加強思想 統治，大興文字獄，又六下江南，花費巨大，但他亦帶來了社 會繁榮、文化發達的「康乾盛世」時期。

The Emperor Qianlong (1711 to 1799 CE) was the 6th emperor of the Qing Dynasty. In the early days during his reign, he aimed at adopting Confucian culture to rule the empire with benevolence. He launched a series of military operations, such as the Sino-Burmese War and Battle of Ngọc Hồi-Đống Đa, to expand the territory. He valued and encouraged agricultural activities. He published the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, which was the largest collection of books in Chinese history. Although he made some bad decisions such as using literary inquisition to strengthen his thought control over the people and going on six southern expeditions, his reign was known as the "Prosperous Era of Kangxi and Qianlong", where the empire was prosperous and culturally advanced.
