Empress Dowager Cixi (1835 to 1908 CE) was the actual ruler of the late Qing Dynasty. After the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, she was named the “Empress Dowager Cixi and started ruling behind the curtain upon elimination of the power of “Eight Regent Ministers”. After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, Cixi initiated the Hundred Days’ Reform and put the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest. Six prominent reformers, also known as the “Six Gentlemen”, were also executed. As Cixi was always dissatisfied with the foreigners, she employed the Boxers, an anti-foreign group, to declare wars on the western powers. After the Eight-Nation Alliance, the Empress Dowager Cixi implemented the New Polices and announced the Principles of the Constitution (1908) in order to gain trust from her people back. Shortly, she passed away in the Hall of Fuchang.
