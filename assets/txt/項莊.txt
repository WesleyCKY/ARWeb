項莊,楚國第一劍客，是項羽的堂弟，並由叔父項梁帶大。在鴻 門宴上，范增好幾次給項羽遞眼色要他殺劉邦，可是項羽並沒 有給予回應。隨後范增叫來項莊上前獻酒祝壽，並請求舞劍， 趁機刺擊劉邦（沛公），不然項莊等人便會成為劉邦的俘虜。 隨後項莊獻酒祝壽後，提議劉邦讓自己來舞劍，但因項伯保護 劉邦而終導致劉邦出逃，刺殺計劃失敗。著名的「項莊舞劍， 意在沛公」便是出自於此，是指說話和行動的真實意圖別有所 指。

XIANG Zhuang, the top swordsman in the state of Chu, was the cousin of XIANG Yu. During the Feast at Swan Goose Gate, he was ordered to assassinate LIU Bang while performing a sword dance. However, the assassination plan turned up to be failed due to the intervention from XIANG Bo. The incident became the origin of a Chinese idiom, “Xiang Zhuang performs a sword dance, his target is actually the Duke of Pei” (「項莊舞劍， 意在沛公」), which is used to describe the true intention of a saying or an action is different from its literal meaning.
