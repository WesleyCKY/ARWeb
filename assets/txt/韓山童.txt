HAN Shan-tong (Unknown to 1351 CE) was a leader of peasant rebellions in the late Yuan Dynasty. Due to the corrupt government at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Han advocated overthrowing the rule of the Han empire. He took a chance to start an uprising and planned to take an oath with his followers in Ying Prefecture. They wore red turbans to distinguish themselves. However, due to information leakage, he was arrested and killed by imperial troops during the oath.
