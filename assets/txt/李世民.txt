李世民（598 年 1 月 28 日－649 年 7 月 10 日），即唐太宗，唐 朝第二位皇帝，漢族。李世民少年從軍，在發動「玄武門之 變」後即位，改元貞觀。李世民在位期間，積極聽取群臣的意 見，對內以文治天下，虛心納諫，厲行節約，勸課農桑，使百 姓能夠休養生息，國泰民安，開創了中國歷史上著名的貞觀之 治。對外開疆拓土，征服高昌、龜茲等，亦設立安西四鎮，各 民族融洽相處，被各族人民尊稱為「天可汗」。惜晚年納諫不 如早期積極，亦漸變奢侈，幸好最終能反省自己的錯誤。

LI Shi-min (598 to 649 CE) was the second emperor of the Tang Dynasty. During his reign, Li actively listened to the opinions and humbly accepted criticisms from the government ministers. He also set up Four Garrisons of Anxi. He made the Tang Dynasty prosperous and peaceful, creating the well-known “Zhengguan era”. He won everyone's respect and the title of “Tengeri Qaghan”. In his later years, he became luxurious, but he stopped doing it and reflected on his mistakes at the end.
