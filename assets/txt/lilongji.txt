李隆基（公元 685 年 9 月 8 日-762 年 5 月 3 日） 即唐玄宗，唐 朝第九代皇帝，漢族。在 除掉太平公主的黨羽後正式掌握權力 後， 勵精圖治，抑制權貴，重視爵賞，納諫諍，禁貢獻，糾正 奢華的風氣。可是到了天寶時期，玄宗逐漸喪失了積極進取的 精神，生活奢華，少問政事，不僅重用口蜜腹劍的奸臣李林 甫，更錯信居心叵測、手握兵權的安祿山，終日只顧與楊貴妃 遊樂，驕奢淫逸，令朝政每況愈下，最終安祿山發動安史之 亂，玄宗逃往四川。在亂事平定返回長安後遭受軟禁，不久後 崩逝。

LI Long-ji (685 to 762 CE) was the ninth emperor of the Tang Dynasty. After having the control of power over the state, he put a lot of efforts in ruling the state and corrected the luxurious habits within the central government. However, during the reign of Tianbao, he gradually turned to be pleasure-seeking and inattentive to the business of the state. He not only reappointed the corrupt government official, LI Lin-fu, but also mistrusted AN Lushan, who had military control. Since Emperor Xuanzong always spent the days with Imperial Consort Yang, the imperial power went down. At the end, An Lushan initiated a rebellion and Emperor Xuanzong fled to Sichuan.
