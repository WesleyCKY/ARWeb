LI Si (284 to 208 BCE) was a famous politician and writer in the Qin Dynasty. He learnt from the Confucian philosopher Xunzi and became one of the representative figures of the Chinese Legalism. After moving into the state of Qin, he assisted the Qin empire in conquering the other six warring countries. After Qin’s unification of China, Li advocated replacing the feudal system with the system of prefectures and counties (under which power was centralised) and burning key texts about the Hundred Schools of Thought. He was also involved in establishing numerous systems for the Qin empire.
