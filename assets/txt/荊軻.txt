JING Ke (Unknown to 227 BCE) was a famous assassin in the Warring States period. He was introduced to the Prince Dan by TIAN Guang when he was in the state of Yan. After the state of Zhao was defeated by the Qin, Prince Dan sent Jing to assassinate the King of Qin. During the inspection of the tributes in Qin, Jing grabbed the King's clothes and attempted to stab him with a dagger. However, he failed and was killed by the guards eventually.
