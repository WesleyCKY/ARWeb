查理·義律（1801 年-1875 年）出身於英國貴族，曾管理奴隸， 後來出任英國駐華商務總監一職。本是反對鴉片貿易，但由於 受到自由黨和英商的壓力，唯有漠視清廷的禁煙諭令。在虎門 事件中，義律一直持强硬態度，即使交出鴉片，他仍然拒絕簽 署切結書。後來在林維喜事件中，義律私自審訊並輕判兇手， 成爲鴉片戰爭的導火線。在鴉片戰爭期間，義律單方面公佈了 《穿鼻草約》，私自派炮艦搶占香港，並出任香港的行政官， 但英國因利益問題而將義律撤職，過了一段日子才獲重新起用他。

Charles ELLIOT (1801 to 1875 CE) served as the Chief Superintendent of the Trade of British Subjects in China. Elliot was once opposed to the opium trade, but due to the pressure from the British merchants, he could only ignore the anti-opium edict from the Qing’s court. In the incident of the destruction of the opium, Elliot adopted a tough stance against the Qing’s edict. In the case of the death of Lin Wei-xi, since Elliot interrogated the murderer individually and imposed a light penalty on him, his unfair judgement triggered the Opium War. During the Opium War, Elliot unilaterally announced the Convention of Chuenpi. He individually sent gunboats to seize Hong Kong, and became the administrator of Hong Kong. However, the United Kingdom dismissed Elliot because of the conflict of interests.
