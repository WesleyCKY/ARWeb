項羽（前 232 年－前 202 年），名籍，字羽，楚國名將項燕之 孫，秦朝末年西楚軍事家。在秦末民變期間起兵反秦，後來在 鉅鹿之戰中，項羽在大破秦軍後，決定乘秦朝覆亡之勢，率山 東六國諸侯滅秦，分封天下，政由羽出，自封「西楚霸王」， 統治梁楚九郡，此時年僅二十五歲。後來，漢王劉邦從漢中出 兵進攻項羽，展開了楚漢戰爭，雖項羽屢屢大破劉邦，但項羽 因分封矛盾引起各路諸侯紛紛反叛，又未能重用韓信等良臣， 最後反被劉邦所滅。不久後項羽自刎而死。

XIANG Yu (232 to 202 BCE) initiated a rebellion against the Qin empire in the late Qin Dynasty.  After the victory at the Battle of Julu against Qin’s army, he divided the Qin empire and declared himself "Hegemon-King of Western Chu". In the Chu-Han Contention, although Xiang always won against LIU Bang, due to the betrayal of vassal kings and lack of support, he eventually got defeated. He committed suicide by slitting his throat with his sword.
