YUE Fei (1103 to 1142 CE) was a famous pro-Song general who fought against the state of Jin between the late Northern Song Dynasty and early Southern Song Dynasty. He led the Yue Family Army to fight against Jin’s army for hundreds of battles. Right after the victories in the North expedition and Zhuxian Town, Emperor Gaozong of Song recalled Yue back by sending him “12 Golden Edict”. During the Treaty of Shaoxing, Yue Fei was framed up by QIN Hui and the others. Eventually, Yue was falsely accused of betraying the dynasty and put to death.
