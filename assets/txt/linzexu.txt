林則徐（1785 年 8 月 30 日－1850 年 11 月 22 日）字元撫，清 朝後期政治家、思想家。林則徐少時貧苦，憑自身的努力，考 中進士，踏上官宦之路，而且任內的政績卓越，因此深受道光 帝寵重，江蘇人民更稱頌他為「林青天」。後來，因鴉片問題 嚴重，道光帝任林則徐為欽差大臣，前往廣東禁煙，於是他於 虎門銷煙。不久後，林則徐因遭受誣衊而被調職，但仍勤奮工 作，如解決水利、開墾荒地 、於祥符縣治水等，功高望重，最 後結束遣戍生涯。在晚年間，林則徐繼續為朝廷辦事如鎮壓反 清藏民、賑災撫民等，並在退休後過住平淡的生活。

In his early years, LIN Ze-xu (1785 to 1850 CE) worked hard and passed the imperial examination. He was admired by the Daoguang Emperor because of his brilliant political performance. Later, due to the growing opium addiction among the Chinese, the Daoguang Emperor appointed him to be the imperial commissioner to stop the opium trade. He first banned the trade in Guangdong, and then, destroyed all the opium in Humen Town. After that, he was transferred upon accusation of being the trigger of the Opium War. In his late years, Lin continued to work for the imperial court, such as suppressing Tibetans against the Qing Dynasty and helping the disaster victims, until his retirement.
