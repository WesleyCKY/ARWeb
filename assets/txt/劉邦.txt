LIU Bang (256 to 195 BCE) was also known as the Emperor Gaozu of Han. Shortly after the Uprising of CHEN Sheng and WU Guang, he assembled 3,000 followers to initiate another rebellion against the Qin empire. In the following Chu-Han Contention, Liu kept losing to XIANG Yu at the beginning, but he made good use of his soldiers‘ talents and turned the tables on XIANG Yu at the end. Liu became the emperor and set the capital in Chang’an. After the establishment of the “Western Han”, he eliminated all the vassal kings who had no relation to the imperial clan. At the same time, he ruled the state with lenient policies and stabilised the feudal system. Liu also adopted the policy of heqin towards the Xiongnu.
