吳三桂（1612 年 6 月 8 日-1678 年 10 月 2 日） 漢族，字長伯， 明末清初著名的政治、軍事人物。在早年時期，吳三桂已經開 始了他的軍旅生涯，如在杏山與清軍的戰役。 在吳三桂「引清 兵入關」後，清軍擊敗李自成，佔據北京，後來又消滅南明勢 力，並在清定都北京後封吳三桂為平西王。在康熙元年，吳三 桂權力和聲勢都達到頂點，清政府便著手裁抑他的權勢。吳三 桂決定起兵叛亂，福建靖南王、廣東平南王二藩都相繼揭起叛 旗，史稱「三藩之亂」。隨後吳三桂在衡州稱帝，國號大周， 不久後病死。

WU San-gui (1612 to 1678) was a famous political and military figure in the period between late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty. After opening the gates of the Great Wall of China at Shanhai Pass, the Qing army defeated Li Zi-cheng and captured Beijing. Wu received the title “King of Pingxi'' (King who pacified the West) upon the elimination of all remaining Ming forces. In the first year of the Kangxi era, Wu started a rebellion against the Qing government, historically called the “Revolt of the Three Feudatories”. Wu declared himself the Emperor in Hengzhou and the ruler of the Great Zhou. He died from sickness eventually.
