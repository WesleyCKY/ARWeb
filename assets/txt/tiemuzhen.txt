鐵木真（1162 年 5 月 31 日－1227 年 8 月 25 日）又稱成吉思 汗，蒙古開國君主。鐵木真年幼時父親被仇人毒殺，與母親過 着終日躲避追殺的艱苦生活，這些劫難磨練出鐵木真堅毅果敢 的性格。後來他參與了多場戰爭如乞顏部、塔塔兒部之戰，把 世仇全部除去，完成了統一蒙古的大業。隨後他建立了一套較 完備的統治體制，令蒙古發展繁榮興旺。鐵木真亦多次向外發 動戰爭如金國、西夏等，為日後元朝的建立打下了堅實的基 礎。可是他也大興掠奪戰爭，屠戮擄掠，功過並存。

Temujin (1162 to 1227 CE), who was also known as Genghis Khan, was the founding Emperor of Mongol Empire. He battled around and removed all his enemies in order to complete the unification of Mongolia. He, then, established a comprehensive ruling system and made Mongolia prosperous. Temujin also launched wars and conquered many Chinese regimes, laying a solid foundation for the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty in the future. However, his conquests led to numerous wars, lootings, slaughters and enslavements. As such, his achievements came with pros and cons.
