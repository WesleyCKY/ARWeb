Emperor Qin Shi Huang (259 to 210 BCE) was the first ruler called the Emperor and claimed himself to be the “Emperor Shi” (the First Emperor). Upon conquering six warring countries, he completed the unification of China and put Han people in the top priority. He implemented the “Three Lords and Nine Ministers” system in the central government, abolished Feudalism, and standardised writing script, infrastructure, as well as measurement. He also pacified the Xiongnu in the north and the Baiyue in the south. He built the Great Wall of China and the Lingqu Canal. In his later years, he was said to be dictatorial due to his obsession with immortality, harsh regulations and brutality to civilians.
